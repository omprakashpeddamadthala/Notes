My responsibilites are  understanding user stories, designing and developing backend components, and ensuring their integration.
I engage in requirement analysis, break down tasks into technical components, and build scalable solutions.
On the backend, I use Java, Spring Boot, and a microservices architecture to create RESTful APIs, manage databases, and optimize performance.
I follow best coding practices, writing unit and integration tests with JUnit and Mockito, and maintain version control using Git/GitHub.
I also manage CI/CD pipelines and implement containerization with Docker for deployments on cloud platforms.
