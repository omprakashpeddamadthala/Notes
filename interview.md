## 1. Class Loading Mechanism

Java class loading is part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which loads, links, and initializes classes. Let's understand it using an **eCommerce** application 🛒.

### 📦 Real-Time Example

Imagine you're accessing a product page:

```java
ProductService productService = new ProductService();
```

Behind the scenes, Java loads `ProductService` class dynamically!

### 🚧 Phases of Class Loading

1. **Loading**: Bytecode of `.class` file is read by ClassLoader.
2. **Linking**:

   * **Verification**: Ensures bytecode is valid.
   * **Preparation**: Memory for static variables.
   * **Resolution**: Converts symbolic references into memory references.
3. **Initialization**: Static initializers and static blocks are executed.

### 🧠 ClassLoaders in Action

```java
ClassLoader classLoader = ProductService.class.getClassLoader();
System.out.println("ClassLoader: " + classLoader);
```

### 🔗 Types of ClassLoaders

| ClassLoader     | Description                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Bootstrap**   | Loads core Java classes (`rt.jar`)             |
| **Extension**   | Loads classes from `ext` directory             |
| **Application** | Loads classes from the application's classpath |

### 🗂️ Custom ClassLoader

You can also create a custom loader for special use-cases like plugins.

```java
public class CustomClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
    public Class<?> loadClass(String name) throws ClassNotFoundException {
        // Load custom logic
        return super.loadClass(name);
    }
}
```

### 🧩 eCommerce Analogy:

* When you click on a product, it's like Java loading the `ProductController`.
* Static offers? They are initialized only once — during the class loading's **initialization phase** 🤑

### 🧪 Test Snippet

```java
public class ProductService {
    static {
        System.out.println("ProductService class loaded!");
    }
    public ProductService() {
        System.out.println("ProductService instance created!");
    }
}
```

## 2. Memory Management in Java

Memory in Java is managed automatically using the Garbage Collector (GC), but understanding how it works helps you write better code! Let's explore this using an **eCommerce cart service** 🛒.

### 🧠 Key Memory Areas

| Area            | Description                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Heap**        | Stores objects (e.g. `Product`, `Cart`)    |
| **Stack**       | Stores method calls and local variables    |
| **Method Area** | Stores class definitions, static variables |
| **PC Register** | Keeps track of instructions per thread     |

### 📌 Real-Time Example

```java
public class CartService {
    public void addItemToCart(String userId, Product product) {
        Cart cart = new Cart(); // Stored in Heap
        int quantity = 1;       // Stored in Stack
    }
}
```

### ♻️ Garbage Collection (GC)

Java automatically reclaims memory used by objects that are no longer reachable.

### 🔍 How GC Works:

* **Mark**: Identify used objects ✅
* **Sweep**: Remove unused objects ❌
* **Compact**: Rearrange memory 🧹

### ✨ Example: GC in Action

```java
Product product = new Product("Phone");
product = null; // Eligible for GC
System.gc(); // Suggests GC to run
```

### 🧠 Stack vs Heap

| Feature | Stack        | Heap             |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Scope   | Method-local | Application-wide |
| Speed   | Faster       | Slower           |
| GC      | No           | Yes              |

### 🧩 eCommerce Analogy:

* Stack is like a **cash counter** where current transaction is in progress 💵
* Heap is like the **warehouse** where all products are stored 📦

### 🔥 Common Interview Tip:

* **Memory leaks** can occur if references are unintentionally held (e.g., in a static map).

```java
static Map<String, Cart> userCart = new HashMap<>();
```

If not cleaned up properly, this prevents GC from collecting unused carts 🧟‍♂️.

## 3. JDK vs JRE vs JVM

Java is platform-independent because of the **JVM**, but often people confuse **JDK**, **JRE**, and **JVM**. Let’s break it down with an eCommerce developer’s perspective 👨‍💻🛒

### 🔁 The Relationship

```
JDK = JRE + Development Tools
JRE = JVM + Runtime Libraries
```

### 🧱 Components Overview

| Component                          | Purpose                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **JDK** (Java Development Kit)     | Full suite for developing Java apps (includes compiler, debugger, etc.) |
| **JRE** (Java Runtime Environment) | Just enough to run Java apps — no compiler 🏃‍♂️                        |
| **JVM** (Java Virtual Machine)     | Core part that runs Java bytecode in memory 🧠                          |

### 📦 eCommerce Analogy

* **JDK** is like a **factory** that manufactures your product (`.class` files from `.java`) 🏭
* **JRE** is like a **store** that sells the product — it doesn’t manufacture 📦
* **JVM** is the **cashier** who actually processes the product when the customer buys it 💰

### 🛠 Real-Time Developer View

As a Java developer working on a checkout service:

* You write and compile code using the **JDK**
* The compiled code is then run by the **JVM**, inside the **JRE**

```bash
# Compile (JDK)
javac CheckoutService.java

# Run (JRE)
java CheckoutService
```

### 🧪 Tip:

* If you're preparing for deployment, ensure the server has the **JRE**.
* If you're building the application, install the full **JDK**.

## 4. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is one of the core OOP principles where **data (variables)** and **behavior (methods)** are bundled together in a class, and access to them is controlled.

It's like packaging your product 📦 and putting labels on it — customers (other classes) can’t just open it and tamper inside!

### 🛒 Real-Time eCommerce Example

```java
public class Product {
    private String name;
    private double price;

    // Only controlled access
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    public void setPrice(double price) {
        if(price > 0) {
            this.price = price;
        }
    }
}
```

### 🔍 Why Use It?

* Prevent unauthorized access
* Maintain control over how fields are modified
* Helps achieve **data hiding**

### 📦 Analogy

* `Product` class wraps internal data
* Only allows interaction through **getters/setters**
* Like you can only view a product's price on the website, but not change it directly!

### ⚠️ Without Encapsulation

```java
public class Product {
    public String name;
    public double price; // Can be changed to -100.0 😨
}
```

This can lead to **invalid or corrupted data** ❌

### ✅ Best Practices

* Keep variables `private`
* Use public `getters` and `setters`
* Add validations in setters if needed

## 5. Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and methods of another class. It helps in code reuse and establishing relationships between entities.

### 🛒 Real-Time eCommerce Example

Suppose we have different types of users:

* **Admin** who can manage products
* **Customer** who can place orders

Both can share some common functionality (like `login`) but also have their specific behaviors.

```java
public class User {
    protected String name;
    protected String email;

    public void login() {
        System.out.println(name + " logged in with email " + email);
    }
}

public class Admin extends User {
    public void addProduct() {
        System.out.println("Admin added a new product!");
    }
}

public class Customer extends User {
    public void placeOrder() {
        System.out.println("Customer placed an order!");
    }
}
```

### 🔁 Benefits

* Promotes **code reuse** ♻️
* Simplifies maintenance
* Establishes IS-A relationship (Customer IS-A User)

### 📦 Analogy

* `Admin` and `Customer` both **inherit** from `User`
* Common features (login) come from parent, specific ones are added by child classes

### 🔍 Types of Inheritance in Java

* **Single** – One class inherits another ✅
* **Multilevel** – Class inherits a class which inherits another ✅
* **Hierarchical** – Multiple classes inherit one class ✅
* **Multiple (via interfaces)** – Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance with classes ❌

```java
public class Seller extends User {
    public void manageOrders() {
        System.out.println("Seller managing orders!");
    }
}
```

### ⚠️ Best Practices

* Don’t overuse inheritance; consider **composition** if it fits better
* Use `super` to access parent class methods/constructors

  ## 6. Polymorphism

Polymorphism means "many forms" — the same method behaves differently based on the object calling it. It enables flexibility and reusability in your code.

There are two main types:

* **Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)**
* **Run-Time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)**

### 🛒 Real-Time eCommerce Example

Let’s say we’re building a `NotificationService`:

```java
public class NotificationService {
    public void send(String message) {
        System.out.println("Sending message: " + message);
    }

    public void send(String message, String medium) {
        System.out.println("Sending via " + medium + ": " + message);
    }
}
```

This is **method overloading** (compile-time polymorphism).

Now, let’s see **method overriding**:

```java
class Payment {
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Generic payment");
    }
}

class CreditCardPayment extends Payment {
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Paid with Credit Card");
    }
}

class UpiPayment extends Payment {
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Paid with UPI");
    }
}
```

Using it dynamically:

```java
Payment payment = new UpiPayment();
payment.pay(); // Output: Paid with UPI
```

This is **run-time polymorphism**.

### 📦 Analogy

* Think of a **checkout button** 🛒: depending on the selected payment method, different logic is executed — same button, different actions!

### ✅ Benefits

* Flexible and scalable code
* Easier to test and maintain
* Helps in implementing **Open/Closed Principle** (open for extension, closed for modification)

## 7. Abstraction 🔍

Abstraction means hiding **implementation details** and showing only **functionality**. It helps in focusing on *what* an object does rather than *how* it does it.

### 🛒 eCommerce Analogy:

Imagine you're using an **Online Payment Gateway**:

* You just click "Pay Now" 💳
* You don't care how encryption, validation, or transaction processing works!

### ✅ Real-Time Example

Let’s create an abstract `OrderProcessor` class:

```java
abstract class OrderProcessor {
    public void processOrder() {
        validatePayment();
        shipItems();
    }

    abstract void validatePayment();
    abstract void shipItems();
}

class CODProcessor extends OrderProcessor {
    void validatePayment() {
        System.out.println("Validate payment on delivery");
    }

    void shipItems() {
        System.out.println("Shipping via normal logistics");
    }
}
```

### 🔍 Key Points

* Abstract class can have both **abstract** and **concrete methods**
* It cannot be instantiated
* Forces subclasses to implement specific behavior

### 📦 Interface vs Abstract Class (Quick Hint)

* Use **interface** when you want to define a contract
* Use **abstract class** when base behavior is also needed

### 🧠 Benefits

* Decouples code
* Promotes reusability
* Great for building **framework-style architectures**

  
## 8. Interfaces vs Abstract Classes

Both **Interfaces** and **Abstract Classes** help achieve abstraction, but they serve different use cases.

### 🔄 Quick Comparison Table

| Feature          | Interface                                          | Abstract Class                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Methods          | Only abstract (Java 7); default & static (Java 8+) | Can have abstract & concrete methods    |
| Fields           | `public static final` only                         | Instance & static variables allowed     |
| Inheritance      | Multiple interfaces can be implemented             | Only one abstract class can be extended |
| Constructors     | ❌ Not allowed                                      | ✅ Allowed                               |
| Access Modifiers | Only `public`                                      | Can use `private`, `protected`, etc.    |

### 🛒 eCommerce Example: Notification

```java
interface Notifier {
    void sendNotification(String message);
}

abstract class EmailNotifier implements Notifier {
    public void sendNotification(String message) {
        connectToSMTP();
        System.out.println("Email sent: " + message);
    }

    abstract void connectToSMTP();
}

class GMailNotifier extends EmailNotifier {
    void connectToSMTP() {
        System.out.println("Connected to Gmail SMTP");
    }
}
```

### 🧩 Analogy:

* **Interface** = Power socket type 🔌 (defines what needs to be plugged)
* **Abstract Class** = Adapter plug 📦 (may have default current but needs customization)

### ✅ When to Use What

* Use **interface** when you want to define a *capability* (`Payable`, `Shippable`, `Searchable`)
* Use **abstract class** when you want *shared base functionality* with some behavior

### 🚨 Java 8+ Note:

* Interfaces can now have `default` & `static` methods too!

```java
interface Discount {
    default void applyCoupon() {
        System.out.println("10% discount applied!");
    }
}
```


## 9. Constructors

A **constructor** is a special method used to initialize objects. It is called when an object of a class is created.

### 🛠️ Types of Constructors:

1. **Default Constructor** – No parameters.
2. **Parameterized Constructor** – Takes arguments.
3. **Copy Constructor** (simulated in Java) – Copies values from another object.

### 🛒 Real-Time eCommerce Example

```java
public class Product {
    private String name;
    private double price;

    // Default Constructor
    public Product() {
        this.name = "Unnamed";
        this.price = 0.0;
    }

    // Parameterized Constructor
    public Product(String name, double price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.price = price;
    }

    // Copy Constructor
    public Product(Product other) {
        this.name = other.name;
        this.price = other.price;
    }
}
```

### 🔄 Constructor Chaining

```java
public class Order {
    private String orderId;

    public Order() {
        this("DEFAULT_ID"); // calls parameterized constructor
    }

    public Order(String orderId) {
        this.orderId = orderId;
    }
}
```

### 💡 Tips:

* Constructor name = Class name
* No return type (not even `void`)
* You can overload constructors
* You can’t define a constructor in interfaces

### 📦 Analogy

* Creating an object is like ordering a product.
* Constructor is like setting the details before shipping it! 📦

## 10. Access Modifiers 🔐

Access modifiers control the **visibility** of classes, methods, and variables.

### 🧩 Types of Access Modifiers

| Modifier    | Accessible Within Class | Package | Subclass (Other Pkg) | Other Packages |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| `private`   | ✅                       | ❌       | ❌                    | ❌              |
| `default`   | ✅                       | ✅       | ❌                    | ❌              |
| `protected` | ✅                       | ✅       | ✅                    | ❌              |
| `public`    | ✅                       | ✅       | ✅                    | ✅              |

### 🛒 Real-Time eCommerce Example

```java
public class Product {
    public String name;         // visible to all
    protected double price;     // visible to subclasses or same package
    String sku;                 // default access (package-private)
    private int stockCount;     // only visible inside class

    public int getStockCount() {
        return stockCount;
    }

    private void updateStock(int stock) {
        this.stockCount = stock;
    }
}
```

### 📦 Analogy:

* `private`: Item in your personal locker 🔐
* `default`: In your warehouse 📦 (accessible in your company)
* `protected`: Shared with your partners 🤝
* `public`: Available to all customers 🌐

### 💡 Best Practices:

* Keep variables `private` and access them through getters/setters.
* Use `protected` for extensibility when subclassing.
* Avoid exposing internals with `public` unless necessary.

## 11. String, StringBuilder, StringBuffer

These are Java classes used to manipulate strings, but they differ in **mutability** and **thread safety**.

### 📌 Key Differences

| Feature     | `String`    | `StringBuilder` | `StringBuffer`              |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------------- | --------------------------- |
| Mutability  | Immutable ❌ | Mutable ✅       | Mutable ✅                   |
| Thread-safe | ❌           | ❌               | ✅                           |
| Performance | Slower      | Fastest         | Slower than `StringBuilder` |

### 🛒 Real-Time eCommerce Example

```java
// Immutable - creates new object
String productName = "Laptop";
productName.concat(" Pro");
System.out.println(productName); // Still "Laptop"

// Mutable - modifies same object
StringBuilder urlBuilder = new StringBuilder("/products/");
urlBuilder.append("laptop").append("?sort=asc");
System.out.println(urlBuilder); // /products/laptop?sort=asc

// Thread-safe Mutable
StringBuffer orderStatus = new StringBuffer("Processing");
orderStatus.append(" -> Packed");
System.out.println(orderStatus); // Processing -> Packed
```

### 🧠 Why String is Immutable?

* Used in string pool 🧵
* Safe for caching, keys in maps, etc.
* Avoids synchronization issues in multithreaded environments

### 📦 Analogy:

* `String` = Sealed box 📦 (each edit makes a new one)
* `StringBuilder` = Editable notebook 📓
* `StringBuffer` = Synchronized notebook with lock 🔐

### ✅ When to Use?

* `String`: Constant values like order IDs, keys, etc.
* `StringBuilder`: Fast operations, single-threaded (URL building)
* `StringBuffer`: Multi-threaded cases (status logs)
