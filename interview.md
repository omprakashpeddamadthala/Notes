## 1. Class Loading Mechanism 🔄

Java class loading is part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which loads, links, and initializes classes. Let's understand it using an **eCommerce** application 🛒.

### 📦 Real-Time Example

Imagine you're accessing a product page:

```java
ProductService productService = new ProductService();
```

Behind the scenes, Java loads `ProductService` class dynamically!

### 🚧 Phases of Class Loading

1. **Loading**: Bytecode of `.class` file is read by ClassLoader.
2. **Linking**:

   * **Verification**: Ensures bytecode is valid.
   * **Preparation**: Memory for static variables.
   * **Resolution**: Converts symbolic references into memory references.
3. **Initialization**: Static initializers and static blocks are executed.

### 🧠 ClassLoaders in Action

```java
ClassLoader classLoader = ProductService.class.getClassLoader();
System.out.println("ClassLoader: " + classLoader);
```

### 🔗 Types of ClassLoaders

| ClassLoader     | Description                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Bootstrap**   | Loads core Java classes (`rt.jar`)             |
| **Extension**   | Loads classes from `ext` directory             |
| **Application** | Loads classes from the application's classpath |

### 🗂️ Custom ClassLoader

You can also create a custom loader for special use-cases like plugins.

```java
public class CustomClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
    public Class<?> loadClass(String name) throws ClassNotFoundException {
        // Load custom logic
        return super.loadClass(name);
    }
}
```

### 🧩 eCommerce Analogy:

* When you click on a product, it's like Java loading the `ProductController`.
* Static offers? They are initialized only once — during the class loading's **initialization phase** 🤑

### 🧪 Test Snippet

```java
public class ProductService {
    static {
        System.out.println("ProductService class loaded!");
    }
    public ProductService() {
        System.out.println("ProductService instance created!");
    }
}
```

## 2. Memory Management in Java 💾

Memory in Java is managed automatically using the Garbage Collector (GC), but understanding how it works helps you write better code! Let's explore this using an **eCommerce cart service** 🛒.

### 🧠 Key Memory Areas

| Area            | Description                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Heap**        | Stores objects (e.g. `Product`, `Cart`)    |
| **Stack**       | Stores method calls and local variables    |
| **Method Area** | Stores class definitions, static variables |
| **PC Register** | Keeps track of instructions per thread     |

### 📌 Real-Time Example

```java
public class CartService {
    public void addItemToCart(String userId, Product product) {
        Cart cart = new Cart(); // Stored in Heap
        int quantity = 1;       // Stored in Stack
    }
}
```

### ♻️ Garbage Collection (GC)

Java automatically reclaims memory used by objects that are no longer reachable.

### 🔍 How GC Works:

* **Mark**: Identify used objects ✅
* **Sweep**: Remove unused objects ❌
* **Compact**: Rearrange memory 🧹

### ✨ Example: GC in Action

```java
Product product = new Product("Phone");
product = null; // Eligible for GC
System.gc(); // Suggests GC to run
```

### 🧠 Stack vs Heap

| Feature | Stack        | Heap             |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Scope   | Method-local | Application-wide |
| Speed   | Faster       | Slower           |
| GC      | No           | Yes              |

### 🧩 eCommerce Analogy:

* Stack is like a **cash counter** where current transaction is in progress 💵
* Heap is like the **warehouse** where all products are stored 📦

### 🔥 Common Interview Tip:

* **Memory leaks** can occur if references are unintentionally held (e.g., in a static map).

```java
static Map<String, Cart> userCart = new HashMap<>();
```

If not cleaned up properly, this prevents GC from collecting unused carts 🧟‍♂️.

## 3. JDK vs JRE vs JVM ☕

Java is platform-independent because of the **JVM**, but often people confuse **JDK**, **JRE**, and **JVM**. Let’s break it down with an eCommerce developer’s perspective 👨‍💻🛒

### 🔁 The Relationship

```
JDK = JRE + Development Tools
JRE = JVM + Runtime Libraries
```

### 🧱 Components Overview

| Component                          | Purpose                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **JDK** (Java Development Kit)     | Full suite for developing Java apps (includes compiler, debugger, etc.) |
| **JRE** (Java Runtime Environment) | Just enough to run Java apps — no compiler 🏃‍♂️                        |
| **JVM** (Java Virtual Machine)     | Core part that runs Java bytecode in memory 🧠                          |

### 📦 eCommerce Analogy

* **JDK** is like a **factory** that manufactures your product (`.class` files from `.java`) 🏭
* **JRE** is like a **store** that sells the product — it doesn’t manufacture 📦
* **JVM** is the **cashier** who actually processes the product when the customer buys it 💰

### 🛠 Real-Time Developer View

As a Java developer working on a checkout service:

* You write and compile code using the **JDK**
* The compiled code is then run by the **JVM**, inside the **JRE**

```bash
# Compile (JDK)
javac CheckoutService.java

# Run (JRE)
java CheckoutService
```

### 🧪 Tip:

* If you're preparing for deployment, ensure the server has the **JRE**.
* If you're building the application, install the full **JDK**.

## 4. Encapsulation 🔐

Encapsulation is one of the core OOP principles where **data (variables)** and **behavior (methods)** are bundled together in a class, and access to them is controlled.

It's like packaging your product 📦 and putting labels on it — customers (other classes) can’t just open it and tamper inside!

### 🛒 Real-Time eCommerce Example

```java
public class Product {
    private String name;
    private double price;

    // Only controlled access
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    public void setPrice(double price) {
        if(price > 0) {
            this.price = price;
        }
    }
}
```

### 🔍 Why Use It?

* Prevent unauthorized access
* Maintain control over how fields are modified
* Helps achieve **data hiding**

### 📦 Analogy

* `Product` class wraps internal data
* Only allows interaction through **getters/setters**
* Like you can only view a product's price on the website, but not change it directly!

### ⚠️ Without Encapsulation

```java
public class Product {
    public String name;
    public double price; // Can be changed to -100.0 😨
}
```

This can lead to **invalid or corrupted data** ❌

### ✅ Best Practices

* Keep variables `private`
* Use public `getters` and `setters`
* Add validations in setters if needed
