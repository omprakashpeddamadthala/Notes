# Key Features of Microservices

1. **Scalability**  
   Each microservice can be scaled independently based on demand, optimizing resource use.

2. **Decoupling**  
   Services operate independently, so changes in one don’t affect others.

3. **Componentization**  
   Applications are broken into small, independent services that can be updated or replaced without impacting the whole system.

4. **Decentralization**  
   Decision-making and responsibilities are distributed across services, each with its own database and logic.

5. **Service Discovery**  
   Services find and communicate with each other dynamically using service discovery tools.

6. **API Gateway**  
   Acts as a bridge between clients and services, managing security, routing, and API optimization.

7. **Flexibility**  
   Allows independent development and deployment of services, though changes may impact multiple services.

8. **Agility**  
   Enables fast, isolated changes to services, supporting agile development without affecting the entire application.

9. **Ease of Adoption**  
   Can be implemented incrementally, making it ideal for agile and iterative development.

10. **Team Expertise**  
    Requires teams with specialized skills to manage and develop individual services.

11. **Technology Agnostic**  
    Each service can use different programming languages or technologies best suited for its purpose.

12. **Resilience**  
    Designed to handle failures gracefully, ensuring one service’s failure doesn’t crash the entire system.

13. **Organized Around Business Capabilities**  
    Services are built around specific business functions, aligning with organizational goals.
